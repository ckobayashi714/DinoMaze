# Design of Game

## Story

The story takes place during the era of dinosaurs. You, the player, are a dinosaur named Dino who has set out on a quest to save the planet from being destroyed. You are tasked to collect mushrooms when you collect enough of them you're able to summon aliens who will help you on your quest.

## The problem at hand

You must not let the clock run out. Otherwise, you die, and the planet gets destroyed. You need to have collected at least 5 mushrooms before you can exit the maze.

## What will be incorporated

I will use sprites with images of dinosaurs and background images that match the period. I will incorporate images, music, and sound effects. I will use a timer to keep track of the player's progress.

## Changes to game

+ I wanted to incorporate AI into this game so the DINO could play against an enemy, but I was unable to implement it due to time constraints.
+ I couldn't figure how to use an algorithm on this game; I wanted to create multiple levels so there would be a feeling of randomization each time a player would press start. It wasn't easy to do, so the idea got scrapped.
